Deadlink-Hunter is an open-source project designed to find broken links in GitHub repositories (with future support for other platforms). The goal is to help maintainers keep their documentation clean, reliable, and frustration-free for readers.

**Deadlink Hunter Website** is the frontend of the project.

You can also check [Broken-Link-Checker](https://github.com/Deadlink-Hunter/Broken-Link-Checker), which is the backend of the project that checks if a link is broken or not.

This project was inspired as a way to give back to the open source community – everyone is welcome to contribute!

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

This is the general design desired for the website, generated by Lovable, just to provide inspiration.

You can check the [more elaborated UI](https://link-guard-191fc128.base44.app) that was created with base44 as initial inspiration:

## 🤔 The Why

Documentation is the first entry point for most developers exploring a project. Yet, README files and docs often contain outdated or broken links – even in large, well-maintained repositories.

**But aren't there already broken link checkers?**

There are — but most of them:
- Don't have user-friendly UIs
- Look outdated or unappealing
- Don't cover all edge cases (e.g., localhost:4000 is not actually broken)
- Lack modern features and integrations

That's why we're building Deadlink-Hunter: a modern, beautiful, and comprehensive solution for link validation.
