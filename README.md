# Deadlink-Hunter🕵️ 

Deadlink-Hunter is an open-source project designed to find broken links in GitHub repositories (with future support for other platforms).
The goal is to help maintainers keep their documentation clean, reliable, and frustration-free for readers.

This is the general design desired for the website, generated by Lovable, just to provide inspiration.

## The why

Documentation is the first entry point for most developers exploring a project.
Yet, README files and docs often contain outdated or broken links – even in large, well-maintained repositories.

But aren’t there already broken link checkers?
There are — but most of them don’t look very good, their UIs are not user-friendly, and their broken link detection doesn’t cover all cases (for example, localhost:4000 is not actually broken).
